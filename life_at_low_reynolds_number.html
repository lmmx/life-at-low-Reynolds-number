<p>American Journal of Physics vol 45, pages 3-11, 1977. <br><i>Editor's note: 
This is a reprint of a (slightly edited) paper of the same title that appeared 
in the book Physics and Our World: A Symposium in Honor of Victor F. Weiskopf, 
published by the American Journal of Physics (1976). The personal tone of the 
original talk has been preserved in the paper, which was itself a slightly 
edited transcript of a tape. The figures reproduce transparencies used in the 
talk. The demonstration involved a tall rectangular transparent vessel of corn 
syrup, projected by an overhead projector turned on its side. Some essential 
hand waving could not be reproduced.</i> 
</p><p>This is a talk that I would not, I'm afraid, have the nerve to give under any 
other circumstances. It's a story I've been saving up to tell Viki. Like so many 
of you here, I've enjoyed from time to time the wonderful experience of 
exploring with Viki some part of physics, or anything to which we can apply 
physics. We wander around strictly as amateurs equipped only with some 
elementary physics even if we don't throw much light on the other subjects. Now 
this is that kind of a subject, but I have still another reason for wanting to, 
as it were, needle Viki with it, because I'm going to talk for a while about 
viscosity. Viscosity in a liquid will be the dominant theme here and you know 
Viki's program of explaining everything including the height of mountains, with 
the elementary constants. The viscosity of a liquid is a very tough nut to 
crack, as he well knows, because when the stuff is cooled by merely 40 degrees, 
its viscosity can change by a factor of a million. I was really amazed by fluid 
viscosity in the early days of NMR, when it turned out that glycerin was just 
what we needed to explore the behavior of spin relaxation. And yet if you were a 
little bug inside the glycerin looking around, you wouldn't see much change in 
your glycerin as it cooled. Viki will say that he can at least predict the 
<i>logarithm </i>of the viscosity. And that, of course, is correct because the 
reason viscosity changes is that it's got one of these activation energy things 
and what he can predict is the order of magnitude of the exponent. But it's more 
mysterious than that, Viki, because if you look at the Chemical Rubber Handbook 
table you will find that there is almost no liquid with viscosity much lower 
than that of water. The viscosities have a big range <i>but they stop at the 
same place</i>. I don't understand that. That's what I'm leaving for him. 
</p><p><img height="472" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure1.gif" width="351" align="left" border="0">Now, I'm going to talk about a world which, as 
physicists, we almost never think about. The physicist hears about viscosity in 
high school when he's repeating Millikan's oil drop experiment and he never 
hears about it again, at least not in what I teach. And Reynolds's number, of 
course, is something for the engineers. And the <i>low </i>Reynolds's number 
regime most engineers aren't even interested in--except possibly chemical 
engineers, in connection with fluidized beds, a fascinating topic I heard about 
from a chemical engineering friend at MIT. But I want to take you into the world 
of very low Reynolds number--a world which is inhabited by the overwhelming 
majority of the organisms in this room. This world is quite different form the 
one that we have developed our intuitions in. 
</p><p>I might say what got me into this. To introduce something that will come 
later, I'm going to talk partly about how microorganisms swim. That will not, 
however, turn out to be the only important question about them. I got into this 
through the work of a former colleague of mine at Harvard, Howard Berg. Berg got 
his Ph.D. with Norman Ramsey, working on a hydrogen maser, and then he went back 
into biology, which had been his early love, and into cellular physiology. He is 
now at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and has recently participated in 
what seems to me one of the most astonishing discoveries about the questions 
we're going to talk about. So it was partly Howard's work, tracking <i>E. coli 
</i>and finding out this strange thing about them, that got me thinking about 
this elementary physics stuff. 
</p><p>Well here we go. In Fig. 1., you see an object which is moving through a 
fluid with velocity <i>v </i>. It has dimension <i>a</i>. In Stoke's law, the 
object is a sphere, but here it's anything; <i>\eta</i> and <i>\rho</i> are the 
viscosity and density of the fluid. The ratio of the inertial forces to the 
viscous forces, as&nbsp;<img height="412" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure2.gif" width="341" align="left" border="0">Osborne Reynolds pointed out slightly less than a 
hundred years ago, is given by <i>av\rho / \eta</i> or<i> av/ \nu,</i> where 
<i>\nu </i>is called the kinematic viscosity. It's easier to remember its 
dimensions for water: <i>\nu</i> \approx 10^{-2} cm^2/sec. The ratio is called 
the Reynolds number and when that number is small the viscous forces dominate. 
Now there is an easy way, which I didn't realize at first, to see who should be 
interested in small Reynolds numbers. If you take the viscosity, <i>\eta</i> and 
square it and divide by by the density, you get a force (Fig. 2). No other 
dimensions come in at all, <i>\eta^2 / \rho </i>is a force. For water, since 
<i>\eta</i> \approx 10^{-2} and <i>\rho </i>\approx 1, <i>\eta^2/ \rho</i> 
\approx 10^{-4} dynes. That is a force that will tow anything, large or small, 
with a Reynolds number of order of magnitude 1. In other words, if you want to 
tow a submarine with Reynolds number 1 (or strictly speaking 1/6\pi<i> </i>if 
it's a spherical submarine) tow it with 10^{-4} dyne in water. So it's clear in 
this case that you're interested in small Reynolds number if you're interested 
in <i>small forces</i> in an absolute sense. The only other people who are 
interested in low Reynolds numbers, although they usually don't have to invoke 
it, are the geophysicists. The Earth's mantle is supposed to have a viscosity of 
10^{21} P. If you now work out <i>\eta^2/ \rho</i>, the force is 10^{41} dyne. 
That is more than 10^9 times the gravitational force that half the Earth exerts 
on the other half! So the conclusion is, of course, that in the flow of the 
mantle of the Earth the Reynolds number is very small indeed. 
</p><p><img height="380" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure3.gif" width="354" align="left" border="0">Now consider things that move through a liquid 
(Fig. 3). The Reynolds number for a man swimming in a liquid might be 10^4, if 
we put in reasonable dimensions, for a goldfish or a tiny guppy it might get 
down to 10^2. For the animals that we're going to be talking about, as we'll see 
in a moment it's about 10^{-4} or 10^{-5}. For these animals inertia is totally 
irrelevant. We know that F=ma, but they could scarcely care less. I'll show you 
a picture of the real animals in a bit but we are going to be taking about 
objects which are the order of a micron in size (Fig. 4). That's a micron scale, 
not a suture, in the animal in Fig. 4. In water where the kinematic viscosity is 
10^{-2} cm/sec these things move around with a typical speed of 30 micron/sec. 
If I have to push that animal to move it, and suddenly I stop pushing, how far 
will it coast before it slows down? The answer is, about 0.1 angstrom.&nbsp;<img height="306" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure4.gif" width="353" align="left" border="0">And it takes it about 0.6 microsec to slow down. I 
think this makes it clear what low Reynolds number means. Inertial plays no role 
whatsoever. If you are at very low Reynolds number, what you are doing at the 
moment is entirely determined by the forces that are exerted on you at that 
moment, and by nothing in the past. 
</p><p>It helps to imagine under what conditions a man would be swimming at, say, 
the same Reynolds number as his own sperm. Well you put him in a swimming pool 
that is full of molasses, and the you forbid him to move any pare of his body 
faster than 1 cm/min. Now imagine yourself in that condition; you're under the 
swimming pool in molasses, and now you can only move like the hands of a clock. 
If under those ground rules you are able to move a few meters in a couple of 
weeks, you may qualify as a low Reynolds number swimmer. 
</p><p><img height="303" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure5.gif" width="737" border="0">I want to talk about swimming at low Reynolds number in a 
very general way. What does it mean to swim? Well, it means simply that you are 
in some liquid and are allowed to deform your body in some manner. That's all 
you can do. Move it around and move it back. Of course, you choose some kind of 
cyclic deformation because you want to keep swimming, and it doesn't do any good 
to use a motion that goes to zero asymptotically. You have to keep moving. So, 
in general, we are interested <i>n</i> cyclic deformations of a body on which 
there are no external torques or forces except those exerted by the surrounding 
fluid. In Fig. 5, there is an object which has a shape shown by the solid line; 
it changes its shape to the dashed contour and then it changes back. When it 
finally gets back to its original shape, the dotted contour, it has moved over 
and rotated a little. It has been swimming. When it executed the cycle, a 
displacement resulted. If it repeats the cycle, it will, of course, effect the 
same displacement, and in tow dimensions we'd see it progressing around a 
circle. In three dimensions its most general trajectory is a helix consisting of 
little kinks, each of which is the result of one cycle of shape change. 
</p><p><img height="388" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure6.gif" width="355" align="left" border="0">There is a very funny thing about motion at low 
Reynolds number, which is the following. One special kind of swimming motion is 
what I cal a reciprocal motion. That is to say, I change my body into a certain 
shape and then I go back to the original shape by going through the sequence in 
reverse. At low Reynolds number, everything reverses just fine. Time, in fact, 
makes no difference---only configuration. If I change quickly or slowly, the 
pattern of motion is exactly the same. If you take the Navier-Stokes equation 
and throw away the inertia terms, all you have left is <i>\nabla^2</i> <i>v</i> 
= <i>p/ \eta</i>, where <i>p </i>is the pressure (Fig. 6). So, if the animal 
tries to swim by a reciprocal motion, it can't go anywhere. Fast or slow, it 
exactly retraces its trajectory and it's back where it started. A good example 
of that is a scallop. You know, a scallop opens its shell slowly and closes its 
shell fast, squirting out water. The moral of this is that the scallop at low 
Reynolds number is no good.&nbsp;<img height="214" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure7.gif" width="215" align="left" border="0">It can't swim because it only has one hinge, and 
if you have only one degree of freedom in configuration space, you are bound to 
make a reciprocal motion. There is nothing else you can do. The simplest animal 
that can swim that way is an animal two hinges. I don't know whether one exists 
but Fig. 7 shows a hypothetical one. This animal is like a boat with a rudder at 
both front and back, and nothing else. This animal can swim. All it has to do is 
go through the sequence to configurations shown, returning to the original one 
at S_5. Its configuration space, of course, is two dimensional with coordinates 
\theta_1, \theta_2. The animal is going around a loop in that configuration 
space, and that enables it to swim. In fact, I worked this one out just for fun 
and you can prove from symmetry that it goes along the direction shown in the 
figure. As an exercise for the student, what is it that distinguishes that 
direction? 
</p><p><img height="388" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure8.gif" width="313" align="left">You can invent other animals that have no trouble swimming. 
We had better be able to invent them, since we know they exist. One you might 
think of first as a physicist, is a torus. I don't know whether there is a 
toroidal animal, but whatever other physiological problems it might face, it 
clearly could swim at low Reynolds number (Fig. 8). Another animal might consist 
of two cells which were stuck together and were able to roll on one another by 
having some kind of attraction here while releasing there. That thing will 
"roll" along. I described it once a s a combination caterpillar tractor and 
bicycle built for two, but that isn't the way ti really works. In the animal 
kingdom, there are at least two other more common solutions to the problem of 
swimming at low Reynolds number (Fig. 9). One might be called the flexible oar. 
You see, you can't row a boat at low Reynolds number in molasses--if you are 
submerged--because the stiff oars are just reciprocating things. But if the oar 
is flexible, that's not true, because then the car bends one way during the 
first half of the stroke and the other during the second half. That's sufficient 
to elude the theorem that got the scallop. Another method, and the one we'll 
mainly be talking about, is what I call a corkscrew. If you keep turning it, 
that, of course, is not a reciprocal change in configuration space and that will 
propel you. At this point, I wish I could persuade you that the direction in 
which this helical drive will move in not obvious.&nbsp;<img height="427" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure9.gif" width="327" align="left">Put yourself back in that swimming pool under molasses and 
move around very, very slowly. Your intuitions about pushing water backwards are 
irrelevant. That's not what counts. Now, unfortunately, it turns out that the 
thing does move the way your naive, untutored, and actually incorrect argument 
would indicate, but that's just a pedagogical misfortune we are always running 
into. 
</p><p>Well, let's look at some real animals (Fig. 10). This figure I've taken from 
a paper of Howard Berg that he sent me. Here are three real swimmers. The one 
we're going to be talking about most is the famous animal, <i>Escherichia 
coli,</i> at A, which is a very tiny thing. Then there are two larger animals. 
I've copied down their Latin names and the may be old friends to some of you 
here. This thing (<i>S. volutans</i>) swims by waving its body as well as its 
tail and roughly speaking, a spiral wave runs down that tail. The bacterium 
<i>E. coli </i>on the left is about 2 micron long. The tail is the part that we 
are interested in. That's the flagellum. Some <i>E. coli </i>cells have them 
coming out the sides; and they may have several, but when they have several they 
tend to bundle together. Some cells are nonmotile and don't have 
flagella.&nbsp;<img height="275" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure10.gif" width="363" align="left" border="0">They live perfectly well, so swimming is not an 
absolute necessity for this particular animal, but the one in the figure does 
swim. The flagellum is only about 130 angstrom in diameter. It is much thinner 
than the cilium which is another very important kind of propulsive machinery. 
There is a beautiful article on cilia in the October 1974 issue of Scientific 
American. Cilia are about 2000 angstrom in diameter, with a rather elaborate 
apparatus inside. There's not room for such apparatus inside this flagellum. 
</p><p>For a long time there has been interest in how the flagellum works. Classic 
work in this field was done around 1951, as I'm sure some of you will remember, 
by Sir Geoffrey Taylor, the famous fluid dynamicist of Cambridge. One time I 
heard him give a fascinating lecture at the National Academy. Out of his pocket 
at the lecture he pulled his working model, a cylindrical body with a helical 
tail driven by a rubber-band motor inside the body. He had tested it in 
glycerin. In order to make the tail he hadn't just done the simple thing of 
having a turning corkscrew, because at that time nearly everyone had persuaded 
themselves that the tail doesn't rotate, it waves. Because, after all, to rotate 
you'd have to have a rotary joint back at the animal. So he had sheathed the 
turning helix with rubber tubing anchored to the body. The body had a keel. I 
remember Sir Geoffrey Taylor saying in his lecture that he was embarrassed that 
he hadn't put the keel on it first and he'd had to find out that he needed it. 
There haas since been a vast literature on this subject, only a small part of 
which I'm familiar with. But at that time G. I. Taylor's paper in the 
<i>Proceedings of the Royal Society </i>could conclude with just three 
references: H. Lamb, <i>Hydrodynamics </i>; G. I. Taylor (his previous paper); 
G. N. Watson, <i>Bessel Functions </i>. That is called getting in on the ground 
floor. 
</p><p><img height="311" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure11.gif" width="274" align="left">To come now to modern times, I want to show a picture of 
these animals swimming or tracking. This is the work of Howard Berg, and I'll 
first describe what he did. He started building the apparatus when he was at 
Harvard. He was interested in studying not the actual mechanics of swimming at 
all but a much more interesting question, namely, why these things swim and 
where they swim. In particular, he wanted to study chemotaxis in <i>E. coli 
</i>--seeing how they behave in gradients of nutrients and things like that. So 
he built a little machine which would track a single bacterium in <i>x,y,z 
</i>coordinates--just lock onto it optically and track it. He was able then to 
track one of these bacteria while it was behaving in its normal manner, possibly 
subject to the influence of gradients of one thing or another. A great advantage 
of working with a thing like <i>E. coli </i>is that there are so many mutant 
strains that have been well studied that you can use different mutants for 
different things. The next picture (Fig. 11) is one of his tracks. It shows a 
projection on a plane of the track of one bacterium. The little dots are 0.1 sec 
apart so that it was actually running along one of the legs for a second or two 
and the speed is typically 20--40 microns/sec. Notice that it swims for a while 
and then stops and goes off in another direction. We'll see later what that 
might suggest. A year ago, Howard Berg went out on a limb and wrote a paper in 
<i>Nature </i>in which he argued that, on the basis of available evidence, <i>E. 
coli </i>must swim by rotating their flagella, not by waving them.&nbsp;<img height="214" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure12.gif" width="381" align="left">Within the year a very elegant, crucial experiment by 
Silverman and Simon at UC-San Diego showed that this fact is the case. Their 
experiment involved a mutant strain of <i>E. coli </i>bacteria which don't make 
flagella at all but only make something called the proximal hook to which the 
flagella would have been attached. They found that whit antihook antibodies they 
could cause these things to glue together. And once in a while one of the 
bacteria would have its hook glued to the microscope slide, in which case the 
whole body rotated at constant angular velocity. And when two hooks glued 
together, the two bodies counter-rotated, as you would expect. It's a beautiful 
technique. Howard was ready with his tracker and the next picture (Fig. 12) 
shows his tracker following the end of one of these tethered <i>E. coli 
</i>cells which is stuck to the microscope slide by antibody at the place where 
the flagellum should have been. Plotted here are the two velocity components V_x 
and V_y. The two velocity components are 90 degrees out of phase. The point 
being tracked is going in a circle. In the middle of the figure, you see a 90 
degrees phase change in one component, a reversal of rotation. They can rotate 
hundreds of revolutions at constant speed and then turn around and rotate the 
other way. Evidently the animal actually has a rotary joint, and has a motor 
inside that's able to drive a flagellum in one direction or the other, a most 
remarkable piece of machinery. 
</p><p><img height="437" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure13.gif" width="342" align="left">I got interested in the way a rotating corkscrew can propel 
something. Let's consider propulsion in one direction only, parallel to the axis 
of the helix. The helix can translate and it can rotate; you can apply a force 
to it and a torque. It has a velocity <i>v </i>and an angular velocity <i>\omega 
</i>. And now remember, at low Reynolds number everything is linear. When 
everything is linear, you expect to see matrices come in. Force and torque must 
be related by matrices with constant coefficients, to linear and angular 
velocity. I call this little 2x2 matrix the propulsion matrix (Fig. 13). If I 
knew its elements <i>A, B, C, D, </i>I could then find out how good this 
rotating helix is for propelling anything. 
</p><p>Well, let's try to go on by making some assumptions. If two corkscrews or 
other devices on the same shaft are far enough from one another so that their 
velocity patterns don't interact, their propulsive matrices just add. If you 
allow me that assumption, then there is a very nice way, which I don't have time 
to explain, of proving that the propulsion matrix must be symmetrical (Fig. 14). 
So actually the motion is described by only three constants, not four, and they 
are very easily measured. All you have to do is make a model of this thing and 
drop in a fluid that you are interested in or not, because these constants are 
independent of that. And so I did that and that's my one demonstration. I 
thought this series of talks ought to have one experiment and there it is. We're 
looking through a tank not of glycerin but of corn syrup, which is cheaper, 
quite uniform, and has a viscosity of about 50 P or 5000 times the viscosity of 
water. The nice part of this is you can just lick the experimental material off 
your fingers. 
</p><p><img height="412" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure14.gif" width="360" align="left">Motion at low Reynolds number is very majestic, slow, and 
regular. You'll notice that the model is actually rotating but rather little. If 
that were a corkscrew moving through a cork of course, the pattern in projection 
wouldn't change. It's very very far from that, it's <i>slipping </i>, so that it 
sinks by several wavelengths while it's turning around once. If the matrix were 
diagonal, the thing would not rotate at all. So all you have to do is just see 
how much it turns as it sinks and you have got a handle on the off-diagonal 
element. A nice way to determine the other elements is to run two of these 
animals, one of which is a spiral and the other is two spirals, in series, of 
opposite handedness. The matrices add and with two spirals of opposite 
handedness, the propulsions matrix must be diagonal (Fig. 14). That's not going 
to rotate; it better not. 
</p><p>The propulsive efficiency is more or less proportional to the square of the 
off-diagonal element of the matrix. The off-diagonal element depends on the 
difference between the drag on a wire moving perpendicular to its length and the 
drag on a wire moving parallel to its length (Fig. 15). These are supposed to 
differ in a certain limit by a factor of 2. But for the models I've tested that 
factor is more like 1.5. Since it's that factor minus 1 that counts, that's very 
bad for efficiency. We thought that if you want something to rotate more while 
sinking, it would be better not to use a round wire. Something like a slinky 
ought to be better. I made one and measure its off diagonal elements. Surprise, 
surprise, it was no better at all!&nbsp;<img height="354" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure15.gif" width="296" align="left" border="0">I don't really understand that, because the fluid 
mechanics of these two situations is not at all simple. In each case there is a 
logarithmic divergence that you have to worry about, and the two are somewhat 
different in character. So that theoretical ratio of two I referred to is 
probably not even right. 
</p><p>When you put all this in and calculate the efficiency, you find that it's 
really rather low even when the various parameters of the model are optimized. 
For a sphere which is driven by one of these helical propellers (Fig. 16), I 
will define the efficiency as the ratio of the work that I would have to do just 
to putt that thing along to what the man inside it turning the crank has to do. 
And that turns out to be about 1%. I worried about that result for a while and 
tried to get Howard interested in it. He didn't pay much attention to it, and he 
shouldn't have, because it turns out that efficiency is really not the primary 
problem of the animal's motion. We'll see that when we look at the energy 
requirement. How much power does it take to run one of these things with a 1% 
efficient propulsion system, at this speed in these conditions? We can work it 
out very easily.&nbsp;<img height="379" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure16.gif" width="294" align="left" border="0">Going 30 micron/sec, at 1% efficiency will cost us 
about 2\times 10^{-8} ergs/sec at the motor. On a per weight basis, that's a 0.5 
W/kg, which is really not very much. Just moving things around in out 
transportation system, we use energy at 30 or 40 times that rate. This bug runs 
24 hours a day and only uses 0.5 W/kg. That's a small fraction of its metabolism 
and energy budget. Unlike us, they do not squander their energy budget just 
moving themselves around. So they don't care whether they have a 1% efficient 
flagellum or a 2% efficient flagellum. It doesn't really make that much 
difference. They're driving a Datsun in Saudi Arabia. 
</p><p>So the interesting question is not how they swim. Turn anything--if it isn't 
perfectly symmetrical, you'll swim. If the efficiency is only 1%, who cares. A 
better way to say it is that the bug can collect, by diffusion through the 
surrounding medium, enough energetic molecules to keep moving when the 
concentration of those molecules is 10^{-9} M. I've now introduced the word 
diffusion. Diffusion is important because of another very peculiar feature of 
the world at low Reynolds number, and that is, stirring isn't any good. The 
bug's problem is not its energy supply; its problem is its environment. At low 
Reynolds number you can't shake off your environment. If you move, you take it 
along; it only gradually falls behind. we can use elementary physics t look at 
this in a very simple way.&nbsp;<img height="403" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure17.gif" width="364" align="left" border="0">The time for transporting anything a distance <i>l 
</i>by stirring, is about <i>l </i>divided by the stirring speed <i>v </i>. 
Whereas, for transport by diffusion, it's <i>l^2 </i>divided by <i>D</i>, the 
diffusion constant. The ratio of those two times is a measure of the 
effectiveness of stirring versus that of diffusion for any given distance and 
diffusion constant. 
</p><p>I'm sure this ratio has someone's name but I don't know the literature and I 
don't know whose number that's called. Call it <i>S </i>for <i>stirring number, 
</i>it's just <i>lv/D </i>. You'll notices by the way that the Reynolds number 
was <i>lv/ \eta, \eta </i>is the kinematic viscosity in cm^2/sec, and <i>D 
</i>is the diffusion constant in cm^2/sec, for whatever it is that we are 
interested in following--let us say a nutrient molecule in water. Now, in every 
reasonably sized molecules, something like 10^{-5} cm^2/sec. In the size domain 
that we're interested in, of micron distances, we find that the stirring number 
<i>S </i>is 10^{-2}, for r the velocities that we are talking about (Fig. 
18).&nbsp;<img height="492" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure18.gif" width="345" border="0"> <br>In other words, this bug can't do anything by stirring 
its local surroundings. It might as well wait for things to diffuse, either in 
or out. The transport of wastes away from the animal and food to the animal is 
entirely controlled locally by diffusion. You can thrash around a lot, but the 
fellow who just sits there quietly waiting for stuff to diffuse will collect 
just as much. <br>&nbsp; 
</p><p><img height="493" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure19.gif" width="419" align="absBottom"> <br>At one time I thought that the reason the thing 
swims is that if it swims it can get more stuff, because the medium is full of 
molecules the bug would like to have. All my instincts as a physicist say you 
should move if you want to scoop that stuff up. You can easily solve the problem 
of diffusing in the velocity field represented by the Stokes flow around a 
sphere---for instance, by a relaxation method. I did so and found out how fast 
the cell would have to go to increase--its food supply. The food supply if it 
just sits there is <i>4 \pi a ND </i>, where <i>a </i>is the cell's radius (Fig. 
19) and <i>N </i>is the concentration of nutrient molecules. to increase its 
food supply by 10% it would have to move at a speed of 700 microns/sec, which is 
20 times as fast as it can swim. The increased intake varies like the square 
root of the bug's velocity so the swimming does no good at all in that respect. 
But what it can do is find places where the food is better or more abundant. 
that is, it does not move like a cow that is grazing a pasture--it moves to find 
<i>greener pastures.</i> And how far does it have to move? Well, it has to move 
far enough to outrun diffusion. We said before that stirring wouldn't do any 
good locally, compared to diffusion. But suppose it wants to run over there to 
see whether there is more over there. Then it must outrun diffusion, and ho do 
you do that? Well, you go that magic distance, <i>D/v</i>. So the rule is then, 
to out swim diffusion you have to go a distance which is equal to or greater 
than this number we had in our <i>S </i>constant. for typical <i>D </i>and <i>v 
</i>, you have to go about 30 \mu m and that's just about what the swimming 
bacteria were doing. If you don't swim that far, you haven't gone anywhere, 
because it's only on that scale that you could find a difference in your 
environment with respect to molecules of diffusion constant <i>D </i>(Fig. 20). 
</p><p><img height="444" src="./Life at Low Reynolds Number, EM Purcell 1973._files/figure20.gif" width="427" align="left">Let's go back and look at one of those sections from Berg's 
track (Fig. 11). You'll see that there are some little trips, but otherwise you 
might ask why did it go clear over here and stop. Why did it go back? Well, my 
suggestions is, and I'd like to put this forward very tentatively, that the 
reason it does is because it's trying to outrun diffusion. Otherwise, it might 
as well sit still, as indeed do the mutants who don't have flagella. Now there 
is still another thing that I put forward with even more hesitation because I 
haven't tried tried this out on Howard yet. When he did his chemotaxis 
experiments, he found a very interesting behavior. If these things are put in a 
medium where there is a gradient of something that they like, they gradually 
work their way upstream. But if you look at how they do it and ask what rules 
they are using, what the algorithm is to use the current language, for finding 
your way upstream, it turns out that it's very simple. The algorithm is: if 
things are getting better don't stop so soon. If, in other words, you plot, as 
Berg has done in some of his papers, the distribution of path lengths between 
runs and the little stops that he calls "twiddles," the distribution of path 
lengths if they are going <i>up </i>the gradient gets longer. That's a very 
simple rule for working your way to where things are better. If they're going 
down the gradient, though, they don't get shorter. And that seems a little 
puzzling. Why, if things are getting worse, don't they change sooner? My 
suggestion is that there is no point in stopping sooner. there is a sort of 
bedrock length which outruns diffusion and is useful for sampling the medium. 
shorter paths would be a ridiculous way to sample. It may be something like 
that, but as I say, I don't know. the residue of education that I got from this 
is partly this stuff about simple fluid mechanics, partly the realization that 
the mechanism of propulsion is really not very important except, of course, for 
the physiology of that very mysterious motor, which physicists aren't competent 
even to conjecture about. 
</p><p>I come back for a moment to Osborne Reynolds. That was a very great man. He 
was a professor of engineering, actually. He was the one who not only invented 
Reynolds number, but he was also the one who showed what turbulence amounts to 
and that there is an instability in flow, and all that. He is also the one who 
solved the problem for how you lubricate a bearing, which is a very subtle 
problem that I recommend to anyone who hasn't looked into it. But I discovered 
just recently in reading in his collected works that toward the end of his life, 
in 1903, he published a very long paper on the details of the <i>sub mechanical 
universe </i>, and he had a complete theory which involved small particles of 
diameter 10^{-18} cm. It gets very nutty from there on. It's a mechanical model, 
the particles interact with one another and fill all space. But I thought that, 
incongruous as it may have seemed to put this kind of stuff in between our 
studies of the sub mechanical universe today, I believe that Osborne Reynolds 
would not have found that incongruous, and I'm quite positive that Viki doesn't.
